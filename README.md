# Web Automation 

This project is about web automation on [Nepse Alpha](https://www.nepsealpha.com/) using `Python Selenium Webdriver` with `POM` design pattern and `Pytest` Framework with `HTML` reporting. 

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [python, pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
- [pytest-order](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-order/)
- [pytest-timeout](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout/)

## Requirements Explaination in Brief: 
- `undetected-chromedriver` : This package is an optimized Selenium Chromedriver patch that does not trigger anti-bot services. Itâ€™s designed to not be detected by services like CloudFlare, Imperva, hCaptcha, and others.
- `pytest-order` : It is a pytest plugin that allows you to customize the order in which your tests are run

```
```
pytest -m high_priority
