# Project Description 

Automated the [Nepse Alpha](https://www.nepsealpha.com/) website using `Python with Selenium WebDriver`, implementing the `Page Object Model (POM)` design pattern for enhanced maintainability and scalability. Utilized the `pytest framework` for testing, enabling efficient test execution and detailed `HTML report` generation. Incorporated various `pytest plugins`, including `pytest-order` for controlling test execution order and `pytest-timeout` for managing test execution time. Implemented `custom markers` such as `smoke`, `regression`, `high_priority`, `medium_priority`, and `low_priority` to effectively categorize and prioritize tests.

## Requirements Explaination in Brief: 
- `undetected-chromedriver` : This package is an optimized Selenium Chromedriver patch that does not trigger anti-bot services. Itâ€™s designed to not be detected by services like CloudFlare, Imperva, hCaptcha, and others.
- `pytest-order` : It is a pytest plugin that allows you to customize the order in which your tests are run
- `pytest-timeout` : It is a pytest plugin that interrupts and terminates tests that exceed a specified duration.
- `@pytest.mark.smoke` : It is a custom marker used in the pytest framework for Python. 
- `pandas`: It is used to efficiently scrape HTML tables from web pages and save the extracted data into Excel files using the to_excel() function.

# How To Setup This Project

**Step 1**: Use the command below to ensure that all softwares have been installed.

```
python --version
pip --version
git --version
```

**Step 2**: Then use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you wish to be download this project. 

```
cd folder-name
```

**Step 3**: Now, use the `git clone` command to clone this project into that folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/prabesh-mah/Pytest-Web-Automation
```

**Step 4**: Once the project has been cloned, open the project using `Visual Studio Code` or any other IDE.

**Step 5**: Run the following command in the terminal to install the virtual environment, to install the essential libraries in an isolated environment. 

```
pip install virtualenv
```

**Step 6**: Enter the command below to create a `Virtual Environment`. **NOTE**: `venv` is the name of `virtual environment`, name can be anything.

```
virtualenv venv
```

**Step 7**: Commands to activate and deactivate the `Virtual Environment`.

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
```
deactivate
```

**Step 8**: After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies for this project.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

# Usage

**# 1**: To run tests in pytest based on `custom markers`, you can use the `-m` option followed by the marker name. Below are the commands and markers that were used in this project.
```
pytest -m smoke 
pytest -m regression
pytest -m low_priority 
pytest -m medium_priority 
pytest -m high_priority 
```

**# 2**: To run all test methods and generate an `HTML report` at the end. 

```
pytest -vs --html='report.html' --self-contained-html 
```

where, 
- `-v` : verbose, provide more detailed output.
- `-s`: stdout, allow print statement to be displayed.
- `--html='report.html'`: This option generate an HTML report with file name **report.html**.
- `--self-contained-html`: Generates a single HTML file instead of HTML and CSS file separately.

## Integration with Jenkins via. Declarative Pipeline

Wrote a `declarative Jenkins pipeline` that automates the process of cloning the `feature branch` from the `GitHub` repository `Pytest-Web-Automation`. The pipeline begins by creating a virtual environment named `venv` to isolate project dependencies, followed by activating the environment and installing the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`. It then confirms the installation of `Python, pip, git, and pytest` by checking their versions. After ensuring that all necessary tools are in place, the pipeline executes one of the `test` using `pytest` and generates an `HTML report` saved in `jenkins_reports/test_reports.html`. Finally, it copies the generated test report to the user's desktop and cleans up by deleting the original report folder from the Jenkins workspace.

### Jenkins Declarative Pipeline Code

```
pipeline {

    agent any

    stages {
        stage("Clone Repository") {
            steps {
                // Clone the GitHub repository where branch is 'feature'
                git branch: 'feature', changelog: false, poll: false, url: 'https://github.com/prabesh-mah/Pytest-Web-Automation'
            }
        } // end of stage 1

        stage("Setup Python Environment") {
            steps {

                    python -m venv venv
                '''

        stage("Copy Test Report To Desktop") {
            steps {
                script {

                    def sourceReportPath = "C:\\ProgramData\\Jenkins\\.jenkins\\workspace\\GitHub\\Pytest-GitHub\\jenkins_reports"
                    def destinationReportPath = "${desktopPath}jenkins_reports"

                    // Copy the report folder to the desktop
                    bat "xcopy \"${sourceReportPath}\" \"${destinationReportPath}\" /E /I /Y"

                    // Check if the copy was successful
                    if (fileExists(destinationReportPath)) {
                        echo "Reports copied successfully to ${destinationReportPath}"

                        // Delete the original reports from the source folder
                        bat "rd /S /Q \"${sourceReportPath}\""
                        echo "Original reports deleted from ${sourceReportPath}"
                    } else {
                        error "Failed to copy reports to the desktop."
                    }
                }
            }

        } // end of stage 6
